# ace-datathon-2019

The ACE Datathon is a competition at ETH Zurich organized by the Analytics Club at ETH (ACE). The competition lasted 24 hours and it had to be solved a Machine Learning Challenge in the field of news popularity prediction. With my team (TeamInt) we finished second in the first part of the competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/acedatathon19-crypto/leaderboard). With the following pitch we secured the first place.

**Competition Details:**

Cryptocurrencies have been a popular trend in finance and technology in the past few years. Daily, a large amount of news articles about cryptocurrencies are published, making it difficult for individuals and investors to make informative decisions. In this challenge, we would like to use social media to predict the popularity of cryptocurrencies related news articles.

In particular, we track data from Twitter and we quantify the popularity of news articles as the number of mentions that an article get on Twitter, i.e. the number of tweets that contain the article's url.

Given the cumulative number of mentions on Twitter in the first hour since an article's publication, and the article's text features (title and sentences), the goal of this challenge is to predict the number of mentions of the article after 24 hours.
